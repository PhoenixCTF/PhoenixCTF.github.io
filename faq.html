<h2>What can I win?</h2>
<p>PentesterLab have stepped up and donated a generous prize pool for the event.</p>
<p>PentesterLab offer practical exercises to learn real world cybersecurity skills, delivered in multiple languages and with certificates of completion to show off to employers. Challenges come with helpful videos and an accessible learning environment.</p>
<a href="https://pentesterlab.com/"><img src="img\PTL.png" style="width: 100%"></a>
<p>you could win:</p>
<ul>
    <li>First Place - 12 months PentesterLab License for each player</li>
    <li>Second Place - 6 months PentesterLab License for each player</li>
    <li>Third Place - 3 months PentesterLab License for each player</li>
    <li>Honourable Mentions - 1 month PentesterLab License for each player</li>
</ul>

<h4>What's an 'honourable mention'?</h4> 
<p>Our way of giving a nod to the folks in the crowd who might not make top 3, but definitely have the most drive!</p>
<p>We'll be looking for teams and individuals that are engaged with the community, and people who embody our culture of helping others build their skills.</p> 
<p>While it's against the rules to give away answers <b>during</b> the competition, some of the best writeups, debriefs, and blog posts in the week after the event will also win licenses.</p>
<p>Successful bug reports and top-tier scavenger hunt submissions are also on the table for prizes.</p>

<h2>What is a CTF? How does it all work?</h2>
<p>A Capture the Flag is a competition where you complete challenges to find "flags", each flag is a small piece of text that you can exchange for a point value; the highest score at the end of the CTF wins!</p>
<p>We use a self-hosted CTFd instance to manage challenges, and keep track of your score.</p>

<h2>How many people can I team up with?</h2>
<p>We have capped the team size at 4 to make sure that all our winners can receive prizes. You can compete on your own or with up to 3 friends. You could even pair up with some like-minded strangers and make new friends!</p>
