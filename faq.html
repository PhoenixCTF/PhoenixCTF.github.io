<h4>What's an 'honourable mention'?</h4> 
<p>Our way of giving a nod to the folks in the crowd who might not make top 3, but definitely have the most drive!</p>
<p>We'll be looking for teams and individuals that are engaged with the community, and people who embody our culture of helping others build their skills.</p> 
<p>While it's against the rules to give away answers <b>during</b> the competition, some of the best writeups, debriefs, and blog posts in the week after the event will also win prizes!</p>
<p>Successful bug reports and top-tier scavenger hunt submissions are also great ways to get on our radar.</p>

<h2>What is a CTF? How does it all work?</h2>
<p>A Capture the Flag is a competition where you complete challenges to find "flags", each flag is a small piece of text that you can exchange for a point value; the highest score at the end of the CTF wins!</p>
<p>We use a self-hosted CTFd instance to manage challenges, and keep track of your score.</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2>How many people can I team up with?</h2>
<p>We have capped the team size at 4 to make sure that all our winners can receive prizes. You can compete on your own or with up to 3 friends. You could even pair up with some like-minded strangers and make new friends!</p>
