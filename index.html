<p>Phoneix CTF is a charity competition for people to learn and flex their cybersecurity muscles, with prizes!</p>
<p>We are also running a virtual Scavenger Hunt! If you don't fancy taking on our cyber challenges, or you just want to flex your legs outside for 15 minutes, give it a go! </p>

<h2>Why are we running this?</h2>

<p>All proceeds go the reconstruction of the National Trans Memorial, which was tragically burned down at Manchester Pride.</p>

<p>The way that security around the memorial was handled during Pride, and the disrespect shown to the memorial over the years since it was first placed, are frankly unacceptable. We want to make it clear that no matter how much people burn down, and no matter how hard people might try to bury our history, we will rise from the ashes.</p>
